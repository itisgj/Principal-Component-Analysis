# Principal-Component-Analysis
-> Created an analysis system for Breast Cancer data, achieving 97% precision in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.

-> Employed two selected components out of a vast dataset, generating a concise map that aids in visualization.

-> Developed a powerful tool for precise tumor classification, utilizing Principal Component Analysis and visualization techniques.

Libraries needed:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn

Step 1: Import the required libraries.

Step 2: Load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets

Step 3: Load the required features and select the two required comparisons namely benign and malignant.

Step 4: Perform the scalar transform on the target matrix and import the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) library from sklearn.decomposition.

Step 5: Fit the data into two components (Malignant and Benign) and plot the graph to differentiate the two components.

Step 6: Generate the final components and store them in the list. Finally, generate the heatmap for Analysis.
